  # TODO: In Chapter 4, Diving into Recursion, on page 59, we built a module called
  # EnchanterShop that transforms mundane items into magical items for sale.
  # Build this module again, but now apply the higher-order functions that
  # you learned in this chapter.

  # TODO: In this chapter, we created a screw factory that processes metal pieces
  # and generates screws. A new requirement has arrived for us: we now need
  # to pack them. We can pack 30 screws per package, and it takes 70ms. A
  # screw is packed when the resulting string is "|o---|" . Change the ScrewsFactory
  # module, adding the simulation of packing screws.

  # TODO: Create a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given
  # quantity. 4 Use streams to produce it. Youâ€™ll need to take a look at the
  # Stream.unfold/2 function. Tip: Try to make the recursive version first.

  # TODO: Implement the Quicksort algorithm. 5 Tip: You can use the first item of
  # the list to be the pivot, and employ the Enum.split_with/2 higher-order function.
